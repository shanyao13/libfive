/*  TreeData is a wrapper struct around the TreeDataVariant.
 *
 *  It's a wrapper struct to make recursive variants work(解决递归变体的问题), since TreeData
 *  had to be forward-declared to be used in Tree.
 *
 *  The struct includes a reference count, to track ownership and destruciton.
 *  This is the same idea as boost::intrusive_ptr, but that doesn't quite
 *  work for our use cases because the top-level Tree destructor wants to use
 *  the heap rather than the stack; otherwise, destroying deep trees can cause
 *  a stack overflow.
 *
 *  For more information on the homebrew shared pointer, see tree.hpp. */
